# request response cycle (client makes request, server returns response)
# request: client is making a function call
# response: what is returned from the function

# request examples: 1) type URL 2) click link 3) refresh page 4) submit form
# routing is what comes after the first / in a link; www.facebook.com/_________ <-- route
# in flask this looks like:

# @app.route("/")
# def some_function():
#     return <some HTML>

# openned virtual environment in terminal
# created root directory called hello_flask
# created hello.py in root directory
